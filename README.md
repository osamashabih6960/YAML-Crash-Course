# YAML Crash Course

This repository contains beginner-friendly information about the **YAML file format**. It's designed to help you get started quickly and confidently working with YAML files.

---

## 1. 🧑‍💻 Human-Readable Format

**YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.  
It uses **indentation** to define structure, making it similar in appearance to Python or plain text.

---

## 2. 🔑 Key-Value Pairs

YAML primarily uses key-value pairs, where the key and value are separated by a colon and a space:

```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30

## 3. 📚 Hierarchy Through Indentation

YAML uses **indentation** (spaces, not tabs) to represent nested structures, such as dictionaries or objects.  
Indentation is critical — it defines the structure of the data, and incorrect indentation can cause parsing errors.

Here's an example of nested key-value pairs using indentation:

```yaml
address:
  street: 123 Main St
  city: Anytown
  coordinates:
    lat: 40.7128
    long: -74.0060

## 4. 🗂️ Lists

YAML represents lists using a **hyphen (`-`) followed by a space**. Each list item is placed on a new line and properly indented under the parent key (if applicable).

### ✅ Example: A Simple List

```yaml
fruits:
  - Apple
  - Orange
  - Banana

## 5. 💬 Comments

YAML allows you to add comments to make your configuration or data more understandable.  
Comments begin with the `#` symbol and can be placed:

- On their own line
- At the end of a line of YAML content (inline)

### ✅ Example: Full-Line Comment

```yaml
# This is a full-line comment
name: John Doe

## 6. 🔢 Data Types

YAML supports several common data types, making it flexible for various configuration and data exchange needs.

### ✅ Basic Data Types

```yaml
name: John Doe      # String
age: 30             # Integer
married: true       # Boolean
children: null      # Null (no value)

## 7. 📝 Multiline Strings

YAML provides two ways to handle multiline strings, depending on whether you want to preserve line breaks or fold them into a single line.

---

### ✅ Using `|` (Literal Block Scalar)

Preserves line breaks exactly as written.

```yaml
description: |
  This is a
  multiline string.
  Line breaks are preserved.

## 8. ♻️ Anchors & Aliases

YAML allows you to **reuse content** using **anchors (`&`)** and **aliases (`*`)**, making your files cleaner and more maintainable.

- `&anchor_name` defines a reusable block.
- `*anchor_name` references (aliases) the anchored content.
- `<<: *anchor_name` merges key-value pairs into a mapping.

---

### ✅ Example: Reuse Settings with Anchors and Aliases

```yaml
default: &default_settings
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3

server1:
  <<: *default_settings
  host: server1.example.com

server2:
  <<: *default_settings
  host: server2.example.com
  timeout: 60  # override

9. YAML vs JSON
YAML is a superset of JSON: Any valid JSON file is also valid YAML.

Readability: YAML is generally more user-friendly due to its clean and concise syntax.

Use Case Preference: YAML is often chosen over JSON for configuration because it's easier for humans to read and edit.


10. File Extensions and Usage
File Extensions: YAML files typically use the .yaml or .yml extension.

Common Uses:

Configuration files (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Compose)

Data serialization and exchange between different programming languages

Automation tools and pipelines (e.g., CI/CD, Ansible, GitHub Actions)

These pointers provide a solid foundation for understanding and working with YAML in real-world scenarios.
